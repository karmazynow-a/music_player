# Music player
Minimalist music player app in Kotlin.

MIT license, target API 28, min API 24

In project I used:
* data binding, 
* service to play music in background, in separate thread, with communication by notifications,
* shared viewModel to store music data,
* and much more

Plans for future development:
* make interactive notification widget, 
* searching through song list,
* artists and albums tabs
